      <description>This is the first research project associated with my PhD. We are interested in the problem of making predictions in an online learning environment with expert advice with prior distributions on the performance of the experts.</description>

      <description>For my first undergraduate student research award, I built a simulation of patient flow through the internal medicine ward at London&amp;rsquo;s university hospital. We have resubmitted a manuscript to INFOR on February 12, 2019 for a minor revision. I presented this work at ORAHS in Oslo, Norway and CanQueue in Edmonton, Canada during the summer of 2018.</description>

      <title>Average waiting time for high priority customers in the M/G/1 accumulating priority queue</title>
      <link>https://blairbilodeau.github.io/research/avg-wait/</link>

      <description>I completed the bulk of this work during my NSERC USRA in summer 2018. We are building on Stanford et. al.&amp;rsquo;s previous results involving the accumulating priority queue. Our current goal is to characterize the average waiting time for high priority customers.</description>
