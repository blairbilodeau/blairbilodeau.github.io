      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD candidate in statistics advised by Daniel Roy at the University of Toronto, supported by the Vector Institute and an NSERC Doctoral Canada Graduate Scholarship. I received my BSc in Financial Mathematics from Western University in 2018.
My research area is broadly statistical machine learning, and in particular theoretical performance guarantees for various sequential prediction settings. Some problems I&amp;rsquo;m currently thinking about are:
Adaptivity: How can we characterize the difficulty of learning data beyond classical stationary dependence structures and design algorithms that adapt to these difficulty notions?</description>
