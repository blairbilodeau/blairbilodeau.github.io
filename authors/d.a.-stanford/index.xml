      <description>For my first undergraduate student research award, I built a simulation of patient flow through the internal medicine ward at London&amp;rsquo;s university hospital. We have resubmitted a manuscript to INFOR on February 12, 2019 for a minor revision. I presented this work at ORAHS in Oslo, Norway and CanQueue in Edmonton, Canada during the summer of 2018.</description>

      <title>Average waiting time for high priority customers in the M/G/1 accumulating priority queue</title>

      <description>I completed the bulk of this work during my NSERC USRA in summer 2018. We are building on Stanford et. al.&amp;rsquo;s previous results involving the accumulating priority queue. Our current goal is to characterize the average waiting time for high priority customers.</description>
