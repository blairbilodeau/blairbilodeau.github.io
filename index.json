We aim to extend these results to the delayed case, where the low priority class waits for some amount of time before accumulating credit. Prior work derived a form for the LST of the waiting time distribution for low priority customers. Exploiting this as well as a conservation law, we are able to compute the high class average waiting time without knowledge of the distribution. This average allows us to quantify the effect of introducting a delay on both classes of customers, and we believe it is crucial to deriving the LST of the waiting time distribution for high priority customers in the delayed APQ.","tags":[],"title":"The average waiting time for both classes in a delayed accumulating priority queue","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1558979100,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558979100,"objectID":"5b16e178f5ec23142c3d01fc4dd52691","permalink":"https://blairbilodeau.github.io/talk/cors19/","publishdate":"2019-04-06T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/cors19/","section":"talk","summary":"In Mojalal et al (2019), the waiting time distribution for the lowest class in the Delayed Accumulating Priority Queue (APQ) is presented. In the Delayed APQ, lower priority class customers wait for fixed periods of time before accumulating priority, leading to longer waiting times over a regular APQ. We exploit a theorem in that paper to quantify the amount of reduction in the mean waiting time of class-1 customers over a regular APQ as a function of the value of the initial delay period d, in a 2-class Delayed APQ. We also quantify the corresponding increase for class-2 customers.

In our hos- pital of interest, a large academic health sciences centre, the physical layout of the unit, current admission process, and the presence of three separate physician teams contribute to uneven workload and communication barriers. We address this by physically co-locating each physician teams’ patients so as to facilitate physician- nurse collaboration, and more evenly distribute workload across all three teams. Based upon one year of real-world data, we developed a simulation model of in- patient flow through the internal medicine unit and determined the impact of two proposed changes: co-locating each team’s patients, and new admission rules for how patients are assigned to those teams. Under the new arrangement, each physician team would interact with roughly half the number of nurses, and nurses in turn would have fewer individual team members with whom to communicate, thereby improving effective communication and increasing time for direct patient care for both physicians and nurses.","tags":[],"title":"Simulated co-location of patients admitted to an inpatient internal medicine teaching unit: Potential impacts on efficiency and physician-nurse collaboration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Blair Bilodeau"],"categories":[],"content":" from IPython.core.display import Image Image('https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png')  print(\u0026quot;Welcome to Academic!\u0026quot;)  Welcome to Academic!

Currently, three physician teams operate on the IM unit, with each team's patients spread over two floors. The project proposed changes to the bed assignment method to geographically co-locate each team's patients in a contiguous area. This thrust would also reduce inefficiency in the number of nurses a physician collaborates with for the same patient load, as nurses are generally assigned to patients in adjacent rooms. This improved efficiency during physician-nurse interactions will lead to better patient care. The other novel aspect to the project was the hybrid assignment of patients to teams. Each patient will be assigned to the first available bed, and the initial proxy for this upon patient admission is the team with the lowest census level. Occasionally, the first available bed will belong to another team, in which case a change of medicine team will occur. A simulation model of the ward was developed specifically to test these changes, and the results presented suggest an implementation will achieve these goals without impacting patient waiting time or occupancy levels. Two new metrics defined to quantify the impacts of the new assignment method were a) the relative number of nurses each medicine team has assigned to their patients, as well as b) the variation between the total number of patients assigned to each team. Simulation results show that the hybrid assignment minimized this variation, while the number of nurses a team has to interact with is significantly reduced.","tags":[],"title":"Simulated co-location of patients admitted to an inpatient internal medicine teaching unit: Potential impacts on efficiency and physician-nurse collaboration","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Blair Bilodeau"],"categories":null,"content":" Academic makes it easy to create a beautiful website for free using Markdown.
