In the Delayed APQ, lower priority class customers wait for fixed periods of time before accumulating priority, leading to longer waiting times over a regular APQ. We exploit a theorem in that paper to quantify the amount of reduction in the mean waiting time of class-1 customers over a regular APQ as a function of the value of the initial delay period d, in a 2-class Delayed APQ. We also quantify the corresponding increase for class-2 customers.

In our hos- pital of interest, a large academic health sciences centre, the physical layout of the unit, current admission process, and the presence of three separate physician teams contribute to uneven workload and communication barriers. We address this by physically co-locating each physician teams’ patients so as to facilitate physician- nurse collaboration, and more evenly distribute workload across all three teams. Based upon one year of real-world data, we developed a simulation model of in- patient flow through the internal medicine unit and determined the impact of two proposed changes: co-locating each team’s patients, and new admission rules for how patients are assigned to those teams. Under the new arrangement, each physician team would interact with roughly half the number of nurses, and nurses in turn would have fewer individual team members with whom to communicate, thereby improving effective communication and increasing time for direct patient care for both physicians and nurses.","tags":[],"title":"Simulated co-location of patients admitted to an inpatient internal medicine teaching unit: Potential impacts on efficiency and physician-nurse collaboration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Blair L.

We aim to extend these results to the affine case, where the high priority class enters the system with some amount of initial credit. Prior work derived a form for the LST of the waiting time distribution for low priority customers which must be solved numerically. Our goal is to replace this with a closed-form solution through combinatorial path-counting methods, and then use this to compute the average waiting time for high priority customers. We can then apply a conservation law to obtain an important probability that characterizes the system, which we believe is crucial to deriving the LST of the waiting time distribution for high priority customers in the affine APQ.","tags":[],"title":"Average waiting time for high priority customers in the M/G/1 affine accumulating priority queue","type":"publication"},{"authors":["B.L.

All the code and data is available on my Github.\nFor this project I chose the option of analyzing some interesting data with Python. Using 3 datasets available from Kaggle, I investigated crime in Chicago from 2012 to 2016. The main goal of this is to explore data analysis in Python, specifically spatial plotting and multinomial logistic regression for determining relationships between crimes and the explanatory variables. Some questions I address are where crime occurs, what type of crime occurs, how crime in the area influences school quality, and how police station locations are related to crime hotspots.\nThe primary dataset used is crimes, which contains all reported incidents of crime in Chicago from 2012 to 2016. To supplement this, there is schools, which contains the progress report card of each public Chicago high school from the 2013-14 school year, and police, which contains location info for all Chicago police stations. These datasets have many fields, so I will only mention the critical ones that are used in a model. First, I import the libraries I will require.\nimport numpy as np import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import matplotlib.patches as mpatches import statsmodels.api as sm from scipy.stats import chi2 from scipy.stats import norm from scipy.special import logsumexp from colour import Color from random import choice  Crime Severity The initial crimes file contains 1,456,714 rows, where each row corresponds to a crime being reported, but I removed 37,174 of these for missing location data. I also excluded crimes from 2017 since there were only 30, so it was logical to just consider years which were fully reported. The field crimes[Primary Type] details the main reason for a crime being reported, and I cleaned this up by removing some white space and grouping types such as “NARCOTICS” and “OTHER NARCOTIC VIOLATION”. I split crimes[Date] into three fields for day, month, and year, and then dropped some redundant fields. A field that may have been useful is crimes[Description], which contains a sentence describing the crime in more depth, but I decided there was too much variability in them to be practical for this analysis.\n## Crimes Data Exploration # We have 1 456 714 rows total crimes = crimes[pd.notnull(crimes['X Coordinate'])] # 37 083 have NaN for location crimes = crimes[crimes['X Coordinate'] \u0026gt; 0] # 77 have 0 for location crimes = crimes[pd.notnull(crimes.Ward)] # 14 have NaN for ward crimes = crimes[pd.notnull(crimes.District)] # 1 have NaN for district crimes = crimes[pd.notnull(crimes['Community Area'])] # 22 have NaN for district crimes = crimes[crimes.Year \u0026lt; 2017] # Only 30 crimes in 2017 # Clean up primary types crimes = crimes.replace({'Primary Type':['NON - CRIMINAL', 'NON-CRIMINAL (SUBJECT SPECIFIED)']}, {'Primary Type':'NON-CRIMINAL'}) crimes = crimes.replace({'Primary Type':'OTHER NARCOTIC VIOLATION'}, {'Primary Type':'NARCOTICS'}) crimes = crimes.replace({'Primary Type':'CONCEALED CARRY LICENSE VIOLATION'}, {'Primary Type':'WEAPONS VIOLATION'}) # Time of event fields crimes['Month'] = [int(date[0:2]) for date in crimes.Date] crimes['Day'] = [int(date[3:5]) for date in crimes.Date] crimes['Year'] = [int(date[6:10]) for date in crimes.Date] # Convert boolean to integer crimes.Arrest = crimes.Arrest.astype(int) crimes.Domestic = crimes.Domestic.astype(int) # Lots of columns we don't care about crimes.drop(['Unnamed: 0', 'Date', 'ID', 'Case Number', 'IUCR', 'Description', 'Location', 'Location Description', 'Updated On', 'Block', 'FBI Code'], axis=1, inplace=True)  ","date":1545195600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1545195600,"objectID":"6884a8e4af6fd90258df0afd1c293133","permalink":"https://blairbilodeau.github.io/project/chicago/","publishdate":"2018-12-19T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/chicago/","section":"project","summary":"Introduction This work is adapted from my final project for STA2101 (Applied Statistics I) taken with Prof. Jerry Brunner.
