Without additional assumptions, minimax optimal performance (measured by cumulative regret) is well-understood. With access to additional observed variables that d-separate the intervention from the outcome (i.e., they are a d-separator), recent causal bandit algorithms provably incur less regret. However, in practice it is desirable to be agnostic to whether observed variables are a d-separator. Ideally, an algorithm should be adaptive; that is, perform nearly as well as an algorithm with oracle knowledge of the presence or absence of a d-separator. In this work, we formalize and study this notion of adaptivity, and provide a novel algorithm that simultaneously achieves (a) optimal regret when a d-separator is observed, improving on classical minimax algorithms, and (b) significantly smaller regret than recent causal bandit algorithms when the observed variables are not a d-separator. Crucially, our algorithm does not require any oracle knowledge of whether a d-separator is observed. We also generalize this adaptivity to other conditions, such as the front-door criterion.","tags":[],"title":"Adaptively Exploiting d-Separators with Causal Bandits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex Stringer*","Blair Bilodeau*"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1643691600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643691600,"objectID":"3ecbf969fe1a9959ffb7fa60d969cfbf","permalink":"https://blairbilodeau.github.io/publication/glmms/","publishdate":"2022-02-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/glmms/","section":"publication","summary":"We describe how to approximate the intractable marginal likelihood that arises when fitting generalized linear mixed models.

For joint density estimation, minimax rates have been characterized for general density classes in terms of uniform (metric) entropy, a well-studied notion of statistical capacity. When applying these results to conditional density estimation, the use of uniform entropy -- which is infinite when the covariate space is unbounded and suffers from the curse of dimensionality -- can lead to suboptimal rates. Consequently, minimax rates for conditional density estimation cannot be characterized using these classical results. We resolve this problem for well-specified models, obtaining matching (within logarithmic factors) upper and lower bounds on the minimax Kullback--Leibler risk in terms of the empirical Hellinger entropy for the conditional density class. The use of empirical entropy allows us to appeal to concentration arguments based on local Rademacher complexity, which -- in contrast to uniform entropy -- leads to matching rates for large, potentially nonparametric classes and captures the correct dependence on the complexity of the covariate space. Our results require only that the conditional densities are bounded above, and do not require that they are bounded below or otherwise satisfy any tail conditions.","tags":[],"title":"Minimax Rates for Conditional Density Estimation via Empirical Entropy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Blair Bilodeau*","Alex Stringer*","Yanbo Tang*"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1613365200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613365200,"objectID":"2e3dd923ae3e4c973a818a15094d0539","permalink":"https://blairbilodeau.github.io/publication/aghq/","publishdate":"2021-02-15T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/aghq/","section":"publication","summary":"We provide the first stochastic convergence rates for a family of adaptive quadrature rules used to normalize the posterior distribution in Bayesian models.

In our hos- pital of interest, a large academic health sciences centre, the physical layout of the unit, current admission process, and the presence of three separate physician teams contribute to uneven workload and communication barriers. We address this by physically co-locating each physician teams’ patients so as to facilitate physician- nurse collaboration, and more evenly distribute workload across all three teams. Based upon one year of real-world data, we developed a simulation model of in- patient flow through the internal medicine unit and determined the impact of two proposed changes: co-locating each team’s patients, and new admission rules for how patients are assigned to those teams. Under the new arrangement, each physician team would interact with roughly half the number of nurses, and nurses in turn would have fewer individual team members with whom to communicate, thereby improving effective communication and increasing time for direct patient care for both physicians and nurses.","tags":[],"title":"Simulated Co-location of Patients Admitted to an Inpatient Internal Medicine Teaching Unit: Potential Impacts on Efficiency and Physician-Nurse Collaboration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Blair Bilodeau"],"categories":[],"content":" from IPython.core.display import Image Image('https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png')  print(\u0026quot;Welcome to Academic!\u0026quot;)  Welcome to Academic!

Currently, three physician teams operate on the IM unit, with each team's patients spread over two floors. The project proposed changes to the bed assignment method to geographically co-locate each team's patients in a contiguous area. This thrust would also reduce inefficiency in the number of nurses a physician collaborates with for the same patient load, as nurses are generally assigned to patients in adjacent rooms. This improved efficiency during physician-nurse interactions will lead to better patient care. The other novel aspect to the project was the hybrid assignment of patients to teams. Each patient will be assigned to the first available bed, and the initial proxy for this upon patient admission is the team with the lowest census level. Occasionally, the first available bed will belong to another team, in which case a change of medicine team will occur. A simulation model of the ward was developed specifically to test these changes, and the results presented suggest an implementation will achieve these goals without impacting patient waiting time or occupancy levels. Two new metrics defined to quantify the impacts of the new assignment method were a) the relative number of nurses each medicine team has assigned to their patients, as well as b) the variation between the total number of patients assigned to each team. Simulation results show that the hybrid assignment minimized this variation, while the number of nurses a team has to interact with is significantly reduced.","tags":[],"title":"Simulated co-location of patients admitted to an inpatient internal medicine teaching unit: Potential impacts on efficiency and physician-nurse collaboration","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Blair Bilodeau"],"categories":null,"content":" Academic makes it easy to create a beautiful website for free using Markdown.
